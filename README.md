VHDL Description of a processor core


This Git Repository gathers all the necessary files for the description of a single-core processor.

Feel free to modify it, and I'm open to advice and commentaries.

All the Test-Benches files are non-necessary in the build of the processor, they are just check-ups files, 
which allow the simulation of a component.
